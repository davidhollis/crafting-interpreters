# Salmon â€” lox in a lower level language (Rust)

This is a lox compiler and bytecode interpreter in the style of Part 2 of _Crafting Interpreters_, but written in Rust. It's incomplete at the moment, but I'm working on it!

To run a script file: `cargo run -- path/to/script.lox`

To start a REPL: `cargo run`
