# crafting-interpreters

Following along with [Robert Nystrom's _Crafting Interpreters_](https://craftinginterpreters.com), [part 1 in OCaml](camlox) and [part 2 in Rust](salmon). This has mostly been a fun excuse to get some hands-on experience in the internals of a programming language interpreter, and I highly recommend the exercise to anyone who's interested in this sort of thing!
